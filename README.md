# isis_data_simulation
The SLANG script is used for testing synthetic data using the package ISIS.
The synthetic data here is simulated using the eROSITA response files and a very simple models. 
Simple fits are then performed to check how good is the parameter recovery for multiple 
synthetic data simulated under the same model and same response functions.

The parameter distributions are then plotted using a python script.
